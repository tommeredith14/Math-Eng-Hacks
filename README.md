# Math-Eng-Hacks
Hackathon code

The Arduino code is in the  Arduino folder
All of the Python code that is actually implemented in the game is in python_class folder
The main program is called mainarcade.py
This project requires a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and external crcuits with LEDs, buttons and a joystick

System mimics a game console through the raspberry pi using a monitor for output and an adruino as a controller

Please bear in mind that everything was made from scratch in under 20 hours and all documentation was written by coders that had not slept for over 30 hours.
